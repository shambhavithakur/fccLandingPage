                        <h3>So fitness is not just about exercise.</h3>
                        <p>Fitness doesn't mean you move your body vigorously for a set duration each day and then forget all
                            about fitness until the next day. Fitness is about moving your body correctly and at the right
                            speed and intensity. It is also about breathing, eating, and sleeping right and being content.</p>
                        <p>No other human being, and ordinary fitness gadgets for that matter, can make you exercise, breathe,
                            eat, and sleep impeccably. At best, they can advice you, and then you have to implement their
                            advice yourself. This can be extremely difficult.</p>
                        <h3>NFit simplifies it all for you.</h3>
                    </section>
                </div>
                <section class='notalone'>
                    <h3>With NFit, you are not alone and on your own.</h3>
                    <p>Let us accept this. Even if you figure out how to exercise and breathe correctly, you can fall back into
                        your previous bad habits when you are distracted by your professional, family, and social commitments.
                    </p>
                    <p>For example, when you are stressed at work, you might forget to breathe correctly or you might adopt
                        a wrong body posture. This saps your energy. It is no surprise, then, that you feel unenthusiastic
                        about exercise and any other healthy habits for the next few days or longer. </p>
                    <p>Not having someone to guide you when you are stressed and feeling lost can take you back to your unhealthy
                        ways. That's why you need a coach with you at all times and not just when you are exercising.</p>
                    <h3>NFit can be your 24/7 coach.</h3>
                    <p>It learns about you from you and coaxes you to do what's right when it's right. And it doesn't need vacations
                        and hefty salaries. It is all about you.</p>

                    <h2>How does NFit work?</h2>
                    <p>NFit is a three-element system that consists of a sensor unit, an earpiece, and phone app.</p>

                    <h3>The sensor unit is where your 24/7 coach resides.</h3>
                    <p>The primary element in the three-way system, the sensor unit learns to identify your body activities
                        through your body signals from Day 1. It processes everything it learns about you into data and suggestions,
                        which it conveys to you through its display panel, the earpiece, and the phone app.</p>
                    <p>The sensor unit can alert you if you are not breathing right and guide you through your exercise routines,
                        telling you what step to take next, which muscles to exercise, and when to change the intensity of
                        your exercise. It can also sense your energy level and make suggestions about what you should eat
                        and drink during your next meal. With time, the sensor unit can learn to make various other suggestions
                        that promote your fitness and well being.</p>
